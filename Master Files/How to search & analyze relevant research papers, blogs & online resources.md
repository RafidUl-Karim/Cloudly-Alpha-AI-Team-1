    "## 📚 4. Follow Research Conference Proceedings\n",
    "\n",
    "Research conferences are often where cutting-edge ideas are first presented. Top conferences are peer-reviewed and feature high-quality papers by leading researchers. Here's how to benefit from them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🎯 Identify Top Conferences:** For example, *NeurIPS*, *ICML*, *ACL*, *CVPR*, *IEEE*, and *ACM* conferences are renowned in AI/ML and computing fields.\n",
    "- **🌐 Explore Conference Websites:** They usually archive papers, videos, posters, and even tutorials/workshops.\n",
    "- **🗂️ Use Aggregator Platforms:** Platforms like [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/conferences) or [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/) track conference papers and often link to their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Benefits:**  \n",
    "Get early access to new ideas, stay updated with trending topics, and understand the direction of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ 5. Use Tools for Paper Summaries and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Research papers can be dense and technical. Tools that simplify and summarize them can make your exploration much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📝 Summary Tools:** Use tools like [ExplainPaper](https://explainpaper.com/), [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/), or [ChatGPT with PDF reader] to get plain-language explanations.\n",
    "- **🧠 AI-Based Exploration:** Tools like [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), [Research Rabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/), or [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) let you visualize connections between papers.\n",
    "- **⚡ Use TL;DR & Highlighted Abstracts:** Some tools and academic search engines auto-generate summaries, saving time and helping prioritize what to read in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Benefits:**  \n",
    "Understand complex papers faster, identify relevance quickly, and discover related work through visual connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 6. Analyze Citations and References of Key Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "Citations create a roadmap of knowledge evolution. They help you understand the context, origin, and impact of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📥 Backward Citations (References):** These show what foundational or related work the paper is built upon. Good for understanding the background.\n",
    "- **📤 Forward Citations:** See which later works have cited the paper. This shows how the research has influenced or evolved.\n",
    "- **🔍 Tools to Use:** [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)’s *“Cited by”* feature, [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)'s citation graphs, or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Benefits:**  \n",
    "Trace development of ideas, find improvements or critiques of the paper, and expand your literature review.\n",
