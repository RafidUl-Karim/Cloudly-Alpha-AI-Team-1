    "## Design Goals and Principles of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental goal of dealing with the complexity of building modern software naturally gives rise to several sub-goals. These sub-goals are directed at the production of quality software, including good implementations of data structures and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three goals of Object-Oriented Programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Robustness\n",
    "The goal of robustness goes beyond just handling unexpected inputs. Software should produce correct solutions even within the known limitations of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user wishes to store more elements in a data structure than originally expected, then the software should expand the capacity of this structure accordingly. This philosophy is present in the `vector` class in C++’s Standard Template Library, which defines an expandable array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, numerical computations should be fully represented, avoiding overflows or underflows. Software should ensure correctness for its full range of possible inputs, including boundary cases such as `0`, `1`, or the max/min possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Robustness and correctness must be designed from the beginning—they do not come automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Adaptability\n",
    "Modern software projects—like word processors, web browsers, and search engines—are large and expected to evolve over many years. Therefore, software needs to be flexible and adaptable to changes in its environment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reusability\n",
    "Reusability goes hand in hand with adaptability. Code should be designed to be reusable in different systems and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing quality software is expensive. This cost can be justified if the software is made easily reusable in future applications—though reuse should be done with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles guide programmers to write clean, maintainable, and bug-free code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be:\n",
    "- Open for **extension**\n",
    "- Closed for **modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we should be able to extend existing code without changing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass **without altering the correctness** of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that derived classes extend the base class without changing their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "Clients should **not be forced to depend on methods they do not use**. Interfaces should be small and specific to the client’s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids “fat” interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.\n",
    "- Both should depend on **abstractions**.\n",
    "- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. KISS – *Keep It Simple, Stupid* Principle\n",
    "Avoid unnecessary complexity. The simpler the code, the easier it is to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. DRY – *Don’t Repeat Yourself* Principle\n",
    "Avoid duplication in code. Repeated logic should be extracted and reused via functions, classes, or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. YAGNI – *You Ain’t Gonna Need It* Principle\n",
    "Do not implement something unless it is absolutely necessary. Avoid speculative additions that are not currently required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. DI – Dependency Inversion / Dependency Injection\n",
    "This principle deals with reducing **coupling**—the degree of connection between components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly coupled systems are rigid and hard to maintain. Using dependency injection or designing with low coupling makes the system more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Composition Over Inheritance\n",
    "Prefer composing objects with desired behavior rather than inheriting from classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leads to more flexible and maintainable code by avoiding deep and fragile inheritance trees.\n"

    "## 🔐 Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Encapsulation?\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the **fundamental concepts** of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the practice of **restricting access** to some of an object's components to prevent unintended interference and misuse. In Python, this is typically done by **hiding the internal state** and requiring all interaction with the object to be done through methods (getters and setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Encapsulation?\n",
    "- **Data hiding**: Encapsulation helps hide the internal state of an object and only expose a controlled interface to interact with it.\n",
    "- **Control access**: It ensures that only specific methods can modify an object's state, which provides **better security** and **predictable behavior**.\n",
    "- **Reduce complexity**: By hiding the complexity, encapsulation makes the object easier to use and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Implement Encapsulation in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is achieved by **using private and public access modifiers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public members** can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "- **Private members** (denoted by `__`) cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. These are meant to be internal to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Protected Members in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Protected Members?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the convention for protected members is to use a **single underscore prefix (`_`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protected members** are **not strictly private**; they are just protected by convention. Unlike **private members**, they can still be accessed directly from outside the class, but it’s generally discouraged.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Protected Members?\n",
    "- **Indicate restricted access**: A single underscore (`_`) tells developers that the attribute or method should be considered **internal** to the class or subclass.\n",
    "- **Support inheritance**: Protected members can be accessed in subclasses (unlike private members, which can’t).\n",

    "In simpler terms, **polymorphism** allows the same method or function to behave differently based on the object (or class) invoking it. This concept is especially useful when working with **inheritance**, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods that are common across multiple classes.\n",

    "## 📚 Types of Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Getter Property**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A method that retrieves the value of an attribute.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Lazy loading, data transformation before returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Setter Property**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A method that sets the value of an attribute with additional checks or transformations.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Validation before assigning a value to an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Deleter Property**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A method that defines custom behavior when an attribute is deleted.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Clean-up tasks when an attribute is deleted (e.g., resource management).\n",
