Human interaction is an excellent way to **clarify doubts, gain real-world insights, and learn from others’ experiences**. However, to make the most out of it, it's important to come prepared.

### 💡 Effective Strategy:

- **Ask Clear Questions:** A focused question leads to a more helpful answer.
- **Engage with the Right People:** Approach teachers, mentors, seniors, or community experts for deeper understanding.
- **Participate Actively:** Join study groups, forums, or communities where you can both learn and contribute.

> Approaching people with background knowledge and a clear question shows initiative, respect for their time, and results in more meaningful discussions.
> Example: Instead of asking "What is machine learning?", ask "I understand that ML involves training models using data—can you explain how overfitting happens during this process?"
